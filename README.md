# Employee-Project
The task: We need an electronic grading system for our employees. The system must take in the employee's name and grades, and perform statistical operations on the data. Grades must be inputted as whole numbers ranging from 1-6 (they may include pluses or minuses eg. 2+ or 5-), and the statistics must show the highest, lowest and average grades of the employees.

In order to use the grading system:
1. Input employee name - Make sure the name does not include numbers or symbols
2. Input employee grades - The grades must be whole numbers ranging from 1-6, but they may include pluses or minuses
3. When you're done inputting grades press 'q' - Statistics will be shown automatically when you're done
